# Internationalization (i18n)

## Current Status

The app currently uses hardcoded English strings. Future localization is planned.

## Recommended Approach

1. **Use flutter_localizations package**
2. **Extract strings to ARB files** (`l10n/en.arb`, `l10n/es.arb`, etc.)
3. **Generate with `flutter gen-l10n`**

## File Structure

```
l10n/
├── en-US.json      # English (US)
├── es.json         # Spanish (future)
└── app_localizations.dart  # Generated
```

## Accessibility Notes

- All interactive elements must have semantic labels
- Color contrast ratio: minimum 4.5:1 for text
- Touch targets: minimum 44x44 pixels
- Support screen readers (TalkBack/VoiceOver)

## String Categories

| Category | Example Keys |
|----------|--------------|
| Common | ok, cancel, loading |
| Auth | signIn, signUp, email |
| Home | todaysWorkout, quickStart |
